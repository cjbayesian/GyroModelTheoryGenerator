[Roll your own GyroModel theory of anything](http://madere.biol.mcgill.ca/cchivers/gyremodel/)
==============================================================================================


Getting Started
---------------

The first step is to source the R script `source('gyre.R')`, which will read in the lexicon table. Next run `theory_gen()` and pass the
topic of your favourite, well, er, anything:

``` R
## For example:
theory_gen("The reason that cats hate dogs")
## or:
theory_gen("Why I procrastinate")
```

And you're off to the races!

Background
----------

This [peer reviewed paper](http://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/2/1/1/)
claims to provide a "theoretical framework \[which\] unifies the macrocosmic and microcosmic realms, validates predicted laws of nature, and solves the puzzle of the origin and evolution of cellular life in the universe."

Forturnately for the reader, the author provides a lexicon table complete with prefixes and suffixes which provide the basic building blocks to create your own non-sensical theory of just about anything you want.
