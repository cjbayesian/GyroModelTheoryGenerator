[Roll your own GyroModel theory of anything](http://madere.biol.mcgill.ca/cchivers/gyremodel/)
==============================================================================================


Getting Started
---------------

The first step is to source the R script `source('gyre.R')`, which will read in the lexicon table. Next run `theory_gen()` and pass the
topic of your favourite, well, er, anything:

``` R
// For example:
theory_gen("The reason that cats hate dogs")
// or:
theory_gen("Why I procrastinate")
```

And you're off to the races!
